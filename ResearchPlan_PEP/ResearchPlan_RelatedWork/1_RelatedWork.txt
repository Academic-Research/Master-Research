Annamali2013Comparison    

Navigation based on Kalman filter.
Hardware components of the navigation system (eletronic compasses): TCM2, HMR3000 and KVH-C100.
Guidance based on waypoint LOS.
Control based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)

Annamali2013Comparison \etal~\cite{Annamali2013Comparison} present a guidance system mainly composed by waypoint line of sigth scheme.
So, the \ac{USV} tries to go straigth ahead from its curernt position untill the next waypoint. If any collision is detected
the guidance system decides next actions according to the line of sights system. For waypoint following tha control system was composed by a MPC autopilot.
In order to decide whether a waypoint has been reached or not, the guidance system considers a \ac{COA} around each waypoint.
The suggested \ac{COA} radius is eauql to the length of the vessel. The current localization is determined by the navigation system equipped with GPS.
For determination of the current heading they combined the information provided by three eletronic compasses (TCM2, HMR3000 and KVH-C100).
For evaluation the system was simulated.

Benjamin2004COLREGS   

For collision avoidance Benjamin \etal~\cite{Benjamin2004COLREGS} explores the usage of a technique entitled behavior-based control and multi-objective action selection.
Different behaviors are defined corresponding to each situation possible such as obstacle avoidance or feep current mission.
Each behavior define objective functions that rates all possible actions with repect to the corresponding COLREGS rule.
The decision space for vehicle action is defined based on variables such as course, speed and intended-time.
They used interval programming to find optimal actions.

Tests are performed with four real kayaks. The navigation system is capable of determine its own position from GPS.
And the USV broadcasts their positions to each other. 
There is no specific detection system, after receive a position information tha USV assumes that the GPS information received correspond to another USV with which it must avoid collision.

Larson2006Autonomous      

    Larson \etal~\cite{Larson2006Autonomous} explore the usage of A* in combination with \ac{VO} \cite{Fiorini1998Motion} as path planner for global guidance. 
    A* is used to avoid stationary obstacles and \ac{VO} is used to avoid dynamic obstacles such as other vessels.
    The navigation is based on waypoints, and the global guidance system is responsible for continuous modification of the existing waypoints route to plan around obstacles detected with long-range sensors.
    %AMA eu havia pensando em usar algo assim inicialmente p teu caso. so adicionar alguns novos wyapoints p fazer o desvio
    The global guidance system presented by Larson \etal~use the information provided by \ac{AIS}, \ac{ARPA} contacts, and nautical charts.
    The \ac{AIS} system receives position, speed and course data broadcasts from other marine vessels with compatible systems.
    The \ac{ARPA} system is capable of creating tracks using radar contacts and can calculate the tracked object's course, speed, and \ac{CPA}, thereby knowing if there is a danger of collision with the other ship or landmass.
    Nautical charts can provide information about water depth, land heights, coastline, navigable ways, navigational hazards, tides, currents, and human-made structures such as harbours, buildings and bridges.
    Nautical charts are used as basic information for running A* and definition of waypoints.
    \ac{AIS} and \ac{ARPA} are used as basic information for running \ac{VO} and definition of waypoints.
       
    There is a perception system for near-field obstacles detection, it is composed of \ac{MWR}, Monocular Camera, and \ac{LADAR}.
    The local guidance system combine the information provided by the perception system and generates a local world-model.
    When an obstacle is detected the new trajectory is defined based on the local world-model and a behavior-based approach.
    There are three behaviors, keep the last planned path, collision avoidance, and free-space path.
    The decision is made through votes. The collision avoidance behavior vote is two times heavier and generates paths in arc format as shown is \ref{Larson2006Autonomous_Arcs}.

Larson2007Advances                          

Guidance: Global + Local
Two levels of map. 
One large overview map, embracing a greater distance but with a lower resolution. 
The information on this map is collected from digital nautical charts (DNC), ARPA contacts, and AIS contacts.
The second is smaller and relative to the area around the USV.
The information on this map is collected from monocular and stereo vision.
In this work path planning for global guidance is responsible for planning routes not only around stationary obstacles but around moving obstacles in the far-field.

They used Probabilistic Roadmaps, genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo for collision avoidance on global guidance.




Collision Avoidance: Occupancy grid
Overtaking - USV moving at a higher speed and both vessels are moving at the same heading within 45 degrees and approaching within 200m
Head-on - USV and other vessel moving at the opposite heading within 45 degrees and approaching within 200m
Crossing - USV and other vessel moving along a heading between 45 and 135 degrees greater than the USV and approach within 200m

Lee2004Fuzzy_logic_for_autonomous_navigation_of_marine_   

Fuzzy logic for COLREGS.
Virtual Force Field for navigation/guidance?
They present a modification of the tradionally Virtual Force Field algorithm, entitled Modified Virtual Force Field (MVFF).
The MVFF method can be used in either collision avoidance or track-keeping modes.
Worried about static and moving obstacles.
Simulation for evalution.

Control: 
depends on desired taks, ship dynamics, ship model, course keeping controller and track-keeping controller
the course-keeping controller attempts to follow the heading angle command. PID for course-keeping.
the track-keepping controller determines the desired heading in relation to the desired track.

VFF method:
At any given point in time the USV is under influence of two forces: 
Fg which acts puling the USV towards the goal and Fr which begins on obstacles and acts repulsing the USV

Lee propose the usage of Virtual Force Field for USV COLREGS-Compliant Collision Avoidance.
They present a modification of the tradionally Virtual Force Field algorithm based on fuzzy logic and entitled Modified Virtual Force Field (MVFF).
The focus is on the determination of the desired USV heading angle components. 
The matematical components proposed consists on keep-track, goal and collision avoidance angles.

The USV route is defined by waypoints, between consectivelly waypoints it is considered a straight line that should be followed
but movement that leads to distanding from the desired path happens when for example a collision avoidance movement is need.
Therefore it is desired that USV motion consider a combination of go towards the goal/next waypoint and keep tracking.

The motion of the USV is mainly defined by the heading angle, Lee propose the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\Psi _d = \Psi _t _k + \Psi _c _a
\end{equation}

The \Psi $_t _k$ angle is related to a combination of the virtual forces that attract the USV, respecting a proportion, to the desired track and towards the goal. 
The proportion is defined using fuzzy logic to determine how near/far the USV is from the goal.
The \Psi _c _a angle is defined using fuzzy logic after detection of obstacle direction, orientation, distance, relative velocity and position relative to the USV.
Each detected value is translated into a weight for fuzzy logic decision. 
For simplicity it is assumed that the USV is capble of only turn right. 
Simulation test demostrates that the presented method is applicable for COLREGS rules 13, 14, 16, 16, 17, and 18.


Naeem2012COLREGs_a  

    For global guidance, Naeem \etal~\cite{Naeem2012COLREGS} use an A*-based algorithm, entitled \ac{DPSS} \cite{Yang}. 
    This method is based on a goal direction vector, being able to reduce the search time by up to 50%. 
    The \ac{DPSS} algorithm produces waypoints around obstacles that form a smoother path with less sharp turns than A*.
    For local guidance, they use waypoint trajectory by \ac{LOS} \cite{Healey1993Multivariable}. 
    Moreover, aimming on \ac{COLREGS}-complaint collision avoidance, they present a manual biasing scheme consisting on avoid possible collision situation detected always sailing towards the \ac{USV} starboard side.
    They argue that always avoiding obstacles, heading towards the starboard side makes the system compliant to the COLREGS. 
    For dynamic obstacles detection, it is suggested the usage of \ac{LIDAR} and cameras. 
    And for the navigation system the suggest the usage of \ac{GPS}
    The guidance system is evaluated trough software simulation.
           
    For collision avoidance, Naeem \etal~assume a \ac{COR} around each detected obstacle.
    For navigation Naeem \etal~assume a \ac{COA} around each waypoint. After the \ac{USV} enters the \ac{COA} the mission planner selects the next waypoint.
    Every time the distance between the \ac{USV} and an obstacle is less or equal than the \ac{COR}, the local guidance system assumes.
    Both dynamic and stationary obstacles are considered. 
    For the control system, Naeem \etal~present a PID autopilot.

Naus2013Idea                                

    In Naus \etal~\cite{Naus2013Idea} the global guidance system uses A* for path planning. 
    Static data about the environment (topography, coastline and safe way), extracted from electronic navigational charts, 
    and dynamic data (position of other ships), extracted from \ac{DGPS}, \ac{AIS}, and \ac{ARPA} sensors are used for generation of a map representation of the world.
    This work do not treat collision avoidance for local guidance.

Soltan2009Trajectory                        

Soltan, Ashrafiuon, and Muske (2009) present the usage of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) 
for aproximation of obstacles position, the ODEs generate ellipsial fields around the obstacles.
In this study the USV mission consists on track another target boat.
The guidance system try to track the target boat going towards it in a stright line, 
if any obstacle is detected the guidance system define a trajectory based on ODEs. 
If the obstacle at any time moves of the way or when the USV goes around the obstacle, the trajectory is then switched to another
The evaluation of the system was done by simulation and any obstacle between the USV and the target boat, in any range, could be detect.

Svec2012Automated 

Svec et al. present automated guidance plan synthesis based on Genetic Programming. An initial version
of guidance plan is generated and then improved by detecting and fixing its shortcomings.
The guidance plan is improved by data mining extraction of vehicle's states of failure and the usage
of Genetic Programming. Their solution is applied to the context of blocking the advancement of a intruder 
boat towards a valuable target.

The guidance plan is represented as a composition of a main navigation controller and a set of navigation plans.

The navigation controller is composed by 
high-level navigation commands such as go-intruder-front, turn-right, turn-left, and, go-straight},
conditional variables such as intruder-on-the-left/right/front/at-back, intruder-has-target-on-the-left/right, and usv-has-target-on-the-left/right,
standard boolean values and operators such as if, true, false, and, or, and not,
program blocks (seq2, seq3), 
and system commands (usv-sensor, usv-velocity, and usv-match-intruder-velocity)

The navigation plan is composed by high-level navigation commands and program blocks.

The leaves of the decision tree can be conditional variables or navigation commands.
The inner nodes can be conditionals variables, navigation commands, or system commands.

Evaluation:     Verified on simulation.
Application:    Blocking the advancement of a intruder boat towards a valuable target.
